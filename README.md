# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
V. Isualize requires more analysis on Pyber data.  The analysis requires a new Data Frame for ride sharing data, group by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural), total fare for the first 4 months of the 2019. Lastly, we want to examine how the total fare changes throught time for each city type using a line plot (Total Fare vs. Weeks).  

## Results
They are 4 main trends we noticed in the weekly fare plot shown below. 
1. The first general trend shows the weekly fares are the highest in the urban city type, followed by the suburban and then rural through the 4-month period.

2. The second trend is that early Janurary has the lowest fares for all city types. A minor deatil to notice is that the rural city types experience their lowest fares in january once urban and suburban city types start recover from their January low fares. 

3. Thirdly, all three city types experice an uptrend which lead to peaks after mid February. This could be explained by the surge of valentine's date activity. 

4. Lastly, the urban and rural weekly fares seem to be slowing down while the suburban city type shows an up trend for the month of May.  

## Summary 
Based on the pybear data analysis, it looks like holidays can create uptrends for each city type.  A further analysis can be done to see which holidays respond to each city type the best.  The most impactful trends will be urban and suburban city types since they show the highest weekly fares. Another suggesting is to have less drivers during the low fare seasons to minimize driver costs. 

There is a description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types. Ride-sharing data include the total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. (7 pt)
