# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
V. Isualize requires more analysis on the Pyber data.  The analysis requires a new Data Frame that includes the city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural), and total weekly fares for the first 4 months of 2019. Lastly, we want to examine how the total fare changes throught time for each city type using a line plot.  

## Results
They are 4 main trends we noticed in the weekly fare plot shown below.   
  
  [Weekly Fares by City Type](https://github.com/rick2stack/PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/Analysis/weekly_Fares.png).  
    

1. The first noticiable trend was that the highest weekly fare were in the urban city type, followed by the suburban, and then rural through the 4-month period.

2. Secondly, early Janurary has the lowest fares for all city types. A minor deatil to notice is that the rural city types experience their lowest fares in January once urban and suburban city types start recover from their January low fares. 

3. Thirdly, all three city types experice an uptrend which lead to peaks after mid February. This could be explained by the surge of valentine's date activity. 

4. Lastly, the urban and rural weekly fares seem to be slowing down while the suburban city type shows an up trend for the month of May.  

## Summary 
Based on the pybear data analysis, it looks like holidays can create uptrends for each city type.  A further analysis can be done to see which holidays respond to each city type the best.  The most impactful trends will be in the urban and suburban city types since they show the highest weekly fares. Another suggestion is to find dates with the lowest fares, we can maximize profit be reducing the amount of drivers during these dates.
